# Neural Network Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
In this project I intend to develop a model that helps Alphabet Soup, an investment company, to make its future investment decisions with more accuracy. In particular, I will use a CSV file including historical data on the company's previous investments and build up a binary classifier on a neural network model. In doing so, I will use different libaries including Pandas, SKlearn, Tensorfelow libraries, I will write python codes in Jupyter Notebook.
