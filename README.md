# Neural Network Analysis

## Overview of the analysis
In this project I intend to develop a model that helps Alphabet Soup, an investment company, to make its future investment decisions with more accuracy. In particular, I will use a CSV file including details such as affilitation, organization type, usecase, rtc. on the company's on which Alphbet Soup previously invested, and build up a binary classifier on a neural network model to make future predictions. In doing so, I will use different libaries including Pandas, SKlearn, and Tensorfelow, and write python codes in Jupyter Notebook to implement and run the model. Specifically, first I will read the CSV file, conduct data preprocessing (removing irrelevant columns, checking for binning options, encoding categorical features, splitting data to training and test subsets, and scaling the input features). Next, I will create and complie the neural network model by initializing an instance of the model followed by adding input, output, and hidden layers to the model, and compiling the model using a binary classifier optimizer. Then, I will evaluate and report the model accuracy (a checkpoint folder is also created and the training result is stored in a .h5 file for future references). Finally, I will complement this process by trying different optimization solutions to enhance the model accuaracy.
